# About me & Bio

Hello,this is Danby,I am a third year student in the IASC program at Brock University.My specific research interest is media archaeology, and It means studying the process of the historical development and evolution of a media, and how it affects todayâ€™s media. This research also reflected in my projects in this portfolio, such as my featured project. In that project, I made a reserch slides which showed a history progress of an old Operating System. This project focuses on the history of the old operating system and the implications and changes for today's operating systems. In the future, I hope to continue to use this project as a game element in my  personal indie game works.
