				So what does Amiga’s rise and fall mean for today’s electronics world?From a public perspective, Amiga is an outdated, failed work, because its function is far outdated and cannot be accepted by everyone, but for media archaeology, Amiga is a witness to computer history.Although in name, Amiga has become a dead media, what it left has always affected the present world. For example, its color processing system has been extended and used by Microsoft and Apple, and its game platform has become the predecessor of Steam and Wegame.

				<h2>Undead?</h2>
				<p>ps:put S button on the keyboard to view the notes</p>

				<aside class="notes">
				Just as in the times, people's definition of demand is also advancing with the times. Perhaps more than a decade ago, computers were not popular. Computers with an Amiga operating system were enough to satisfy people’s entertainment needs. But today, with TV games and VR games, people will only stay in computers. On the game of operation, the answer is no.This is reasonable because the media world is not so friendly. Except for Amiga, the NS and OMB operating systems developed over the same period were eliminated for the same reason. But the results from the data update show that they have not completely disappeared, and the world still allows people to use and develop these outdated operating systems. And it itself has become the existence of a living dead.

			 	<aside class="notes">
				Of course... we can't prematurely conclude why it is likely that the outdated media will reappear in the public eye.In fact, before the promotion of Amiga's simple wrokbench, everyone has been cumbersome about the complicated Windows interface of Windows 95. It is also the simplified precedent of Aimiga that the operating system design will be more simple and beautiful.This is one example where the product changes with the user's preferences. The same was true for the operation of computers from 1987 to 1992 from complex to simple.
