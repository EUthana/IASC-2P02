				<h2>Media archaeology, kinda</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
				So what does Amiga’s rise and fall mean for today’s electronics world?From a public perspective, Amiga is an outdated, failed work, because its function is far outdated and cannot be accepted by everyone, but for media archaeology, Amiga is a witness to computer history.Although in name, Amiga has become a dead media, what it left has always affected the present world. For example, its color processing system has been extended and used by Microsoft and Apple, and its game platform has become the predecessor of Steam and Wegame.

				<h2>Undead?</h2>
				<p>ps:put S button on the keyboard to view the notes</p>

				<aside class="notes">
				Just as in the times, people's definition of demand is also advancing with the times. Perhaps more than a decade ago, computers were not popular. Computers with an Amiga operating system were enough to satisfy people’s entertainment needs. But today, with TV games and VR games, people will only stay in computers. On the game of operation, the answer is no.This is reasonable because the media world is not so friendly. Except for Amiga, the NS and OMB operating systems developed over the same period were eliminated for the same reason. But the results from the data update show that they have not completely disappeared, and the world still allows people to use and develop these outdated operating systems. And it itself has become the existence of a living dead.

			 	<aside class="notes">
				Of course... we can't prematurely conclude why it is likely that the outdated media will reappear in the public eye.In fact, before the promotion of Amiga's simple wrokbench, everyone has been cumbersome about the complicated Windows interface of Windows 95. It is also the simplified precedent of Aimiga that the operating system design will be more simple and beautiful.This is one example where the product changes with the user's preferences. The same was true for the operation of computers from 1987 to 1992 from complex to simple.

				<h2>Another one</h2>
				<p>ps:put S button on the keyboard to view the notes</p>
				<aside class="notes">
				Let's take another example. How to judge the Amiga game on the Amiga system and the Steam game platform on the Windows system?The latter is naturally familiar, and the former has to be said to be quite successful as a game platform of the first generation. As of 2001, the total number of games on the Amiga platform has surpassed 1,500. In addition to the common pixel 2D games, there are also a small number of 3D games.In the era when mobile games and video games were not popular, the Amiga platform has a milestone in the history of game development, because it not only represents a game platform, but also builds a large game network.Steam is based on this to raise the game network to the Internet instead of the LAN.

				<h2>the END</h2>
				<p>ps:put S button on the keyboard to view the notes</p>
				<aside class="notes">
				Perhaps it is just like my topic, the phantom of the Amiga. Although there have been brilliant moments, it was eventually buried in time. Like a phantom in the computer age.But at the same time, we also want to thank this Amiga. Without its former glory, we might not have experienced the full-color game and operation experience early.To speak farther, it is precisely with these examples that have been eliminated, the replacement of the operating system will continue to absorb the experience of failure to have the scope of promotion today.
